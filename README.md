# Camera Response Function Calibration Algorithm Based on Multi-exposure Images
The code is for CRF_Calibration.  The *.m files are implemented on MATLAB.
This code is for paper "Camera Response Function Calibration Algorithm Based on Multi-exposure Images, 2023", Acta Optica Sinica.
The images are captured by Daheng industrical camera (MER2-503-36U3C).
